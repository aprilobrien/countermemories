							<p class="major">This webtext examines the role of MEmorial in public memory research in two modes: via a video essay and a virtual reality (VR) spatialized experience. Because MEmorial is a visual-material methodology, the images, voice, and background music contribute nuance and affect to the argument. While the summary text below complements the video and VR counter tour, it does not replace them.</p>

							<h2>Video Essay</h2>
							<p>In this video essay, I question the rhetorical implications of memorialization in the American South, specifically the public discourse surrounding Pendleton’s historic markers, memorials, and plantation houses. Arguing against memorials that distance people from public memory, as well as the socio-political issues that surround Southern histories, this project intervenes in Pendleton’s problematic discourses via a crowdsourced community writing project called, Counter-Tour: Remembering Black History in Pendleton, South Carolina. This project takes form through 360° virtual reality (VR), which utilizes 360° images of the spaces, places, and objects in Pendleton, along with embedded informative text, video, and/or photos. As a collaborative endeavor, Counter-Tour draws from historical archives, as well the oral histories I collected from Black residents in Pendleton as well as the town’s historical archives. The ultimate purpose of the project is to remember and circulate Pendleton’s un(der)recognized rich and nuanced Black histories to a network of publics. </p>

							<h2>VR Countertour</h2>
							<p>Pendleton, South Carolina is a historic, rural town located in the upstate near Clemson University. While the town of Pendleton highlights various historical spaces, places, and individuals, the Pendleton Foundation for Black History and Culture seeks to raise awareness about the town's Black history, which includes individuals like Benjamin Keese, Robert Henry Thompson, Albert Gantt, and Jane Hunter and includes spaces and places like Keese Barn, Faith Cabin Library, Riverside School, the Dog House, and the Pendleton Community Center. This counter-tour runs contrary to any narrative that erases or sanitizes Pendleton's Black history.</p>

							<h2>Defining MEmorial</h2>
							<p>MEmorial is as an artifact that is quite different from a memorial, monument, or historical marker in three distinct ways. First, most memorials represent the dominant narrative of a culture. In the case of the American South, this narrative is predominately one that still valorizes the Old South and minimizes or erases unpleasant historical events like the transatlantic and domestic slave trade, Jim Crow, and a persistent culture of segregation and racism (Alderman, 2012; Loewen, 1999). In contrast, MEmorial looks to represent the unrecognized abject suffering in a space or place, and in doing so, pushes back on dominant narratives (Ulmer, 2005).

Second, memorials usually cause us to distance ourselves from what is being remembered as the objective bystander, or as Dickinson, Ott, and Aoki (2006) explain it, “with a reverent eye” that encourages visitors to keep a distant eye that admires without contemplating the implications of white Americans in our nation’s tragic history. MEmorial, however, is an inward-facing and contemplative practice that considers how we interact with spaces and places and how those spaces and places remember various historical events.

Third, memorials are generally placed in communities without the involvement or inspiration of those community members. They neither represent the values or goals of the community, and oftentimes, they are not welcomed. However, community engagement is one of the most compelling aspects of MEmorial. A true MEmorial represents both the individual and collective component, and without the input of the community, a MEmorial is just another navel-gazing academic practice. MEmorial creates what Legg (2005) calls “sites of countermemory” that disrupt stagnant narratives that tell one story and remember stories that have been suppressed.

							<h2>Personal Responsibility</h2>
							<p>In this project, the issue that I focus most on is the way memorials distance us from what is being memorialized. As Dickinson, Ott, and Aoki (2006) point out, we are taught to reverence but not identify with what is being memorialized. Similarly, as Rice (2012) establishes, it is easy to write ourselves outside the scene of rhetorical action too soon (p. 177). Assembling together these two overlapping ideas, I see MEmorial as a potential way to mitigate these issues facing traditional memorials and monuments. Where traditional memorials cause us to look outward – and distance ourselves – MEmorial forces us to consider how “Problems B Us” and look inward (Ulmer, 2003, p. 7). What exactly does “Problems B Us” mean though? Instead of Problems B You, them, anyone else other than me, Problems B Us considers the range of personal responsibility in socio-political, environmental, and ecological issues. As an example of how individuals tend to distance themselves from social problems, Paul Wright (2018), activist and editor of Prison Legal News, explains in the documentary American Jail how wealthy people disassociate themselves from issues of explicit racism in their communities: “People in rich suburbs don’t want to talk about the zoning restrictions that they have that are there to keep poor people out, and blacks are disproportionately poor in this country. Those are real issues, but no one looks in the mirror and says, ‘How am I contributing to the problem?’” Wright’s explanation of why issues like zoning restrictions and other forms of spatialized racism do not change, as well as my argument about the problem with traditional memorials, is why I position MEmorial as an intervention – both in Pendleton as well as around the American South and the United States as well.</p>

							<h2>Sites of Countermemory</h2>
							<p>The MEmorial in Pendleton fulfils what Legg (2005) calls a “site of counter-memory” (p. 180). Likewise, O'Brien & Sanchez (forthcoming) define rhetorical countermemory as a "marginalized (or often erased) form of remembering, one that resituates the narratives of the oppressed or forgotten as equal to dominant narratives and often contains the same—if not more—historical evidence." Sites of countermemory are slowly being introduced into the discourse in the United States, but this is definitely a slow process. Some include the African American Family Monument in Savannah, Georgia, the Whitney Plantation in Wallace, Louisiana, and  the National Memorial for Peace and Justice (NMPJ) in Montgomery, Alabama. The NMPJ remembers the 4400 men, women, and children who were killed by white mobs between 1877 and 1950. The accompanying museum, The Legacy Museum: From Enslavement to Mass Incarceration, uses immersive media to draw connections between enslavement and prison life. These two sites, created in an effort by criminal defense attorney Bryan Stevenson, seek to subvert how we remember our histories (EJI, 2020). These sites of countermemory inspired and informed the MEmorial Counter-Tour, and the concept of MEMorial has the capability of shifting the way we define and practice public memory in rhetoric and writing studies.
